Each complaint may contain multiple allegations, such as rudeness and inappropriate language. Each allegation receives separate findings.
There are four possible findings:

**Sustained** means that the majority of the evidence proved that the allegation occurred and was in violation of a department policy.  When allegations are sustained, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.

**Not sustained** means there was no majority of evidence to prove or disprove the allegation.

**Exonerated** means the majority of the evidence proved the allegation occurred, but it was within department policy.

**Unfounded** means the majority of the evidence disproved that the allegation occurred.

All findings remain on an officer’s personnel record.

Complaints that are still being investigated are shown as **unspecified** in this chart.

This open data project is the result of a partnership between the Indianapolis Department of Public Safety and Code for America. It opens data that CPCO and IMPD have been collecting internally, but that has not been shared publicly before.

**About the Citizens’ Police Complaint Office**

The Citizens' Police Complaint Office (CPCO) is an office, independent of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, created by City Ordinance. It affords citizens of Indianapolis who believe they have been treated improperly by an IMPD officer the opportunity to have their complaints articulated and investigated.

The Citizens' Police Complaint Board is a twelve member board consisting of nine civilian voting members and three non-voting police officers. These members are appointed by the City-County Council, the Mayor, and the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and have the task of reviewing all formal cases filed in the CPCO.

More information about the complaint process is available at the [CPCO website](http://www.indy.gov/egov/city/dps/cpco/pages/home.aspx) and [FAQ](http://www.indy.gov/eGov/City/DPS/CPCO/Pages/faq.aspx).

In 2015, the Citizens Police Complaint Office has done a large amount of outreach to let more people know that our office exists to hear and investigate their grievances, as well as made it easier to submit complaints online. The CPCO has also worked to decrease the average time from when a formal complaint is submitted to when it is discussed at a hearing by our Citizens Police Complaint Board. In 2013, the average was 9-18 months – In 2014, it was down to 5 months, and the 2015 average is under three months. We strive to treat complainants individually and fairly regardless of the nature of their complaint.

[The Indianapolis Ordinance that established the CPCO is Chapter 251, Article 1, Division 3](https://www.municode.com/library/in/indianapolis_-_marion_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITIORAD_CH251DEPUSA_ARTIINGE_DIV3CIPOCOPR).

**Why we're sharing this data - transparency to build trust**

We believe that being transparent about our work will help us better serve the people of Indianapolis, and that being accountable to our citizens will allow us to work together to improve relationships between IMPD and Indianapolis residents.

**What you can do with this data**

We have done some initial analysis on this dataset, though there are many other ways the data can be compared and analyzed. The underlying data is available [here](https://www.projectcomport.org/department/IMPD/schema/complaints) for public use.""",
